<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-score-difference-in-a-game">Find the Score Difference in a Game</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange' alt='Difficulty: Medium' /> <hr> <p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code>, where <code>nums[i]</code> represents the points scored in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> game.</p> <p>There are <strong>exactly two players</strong>. Initially, the first player is <strong>active</strong> and the second player is <strong>inactive</strong>.</p> <p>The following rules apply <strong>sequentially</strong> for each game <code>i</code>:</p> <ul> <li>If <code>nums[i]</code> is <strong>odd</strong>, the active and inactive players swap roles.</li> <li>In every 6th game (that is, game indices <code>5, 11, 17, ...</code>), the active and inactive players swap roles.</li> <li>The active player plays the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> game and gains <code>nums[i]</code> points.</li> </ul> <p>Return the <strong>score difference</strong>, defined as the first player's total score minus the second player's total score.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p> <pre> <strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3] <strong>Output:</strong> 0 <strong>Explanation:</strong> Game 0: Since 1 is odd, players swap. The second player becomes active and gains 1 point. Game 1: No swap occurs. The second player gains 2 points. Game 2: Since 3 is odd, players swap. The first player becomes active and gains 3 points. First player's total = 3 Second player's total = 1 + 2 = 3 Score difference = 3 - 3 = 0 </pre> <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p> <pre> <strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,4,2,1,2,1] <strong>Output:</strong> 4 <strong>Explanation:</strong> Game 0: First player gains 2. Game 1: First player gains 4. Game 2: First player gains 2. Game 3: Since 1 is odd, players swap. Second player gains 1. Game 4: Second player gains 2. Game 5: Since 1 is odd, players swap. Since this is the 6th game (index 5), players swap again. Second player gains 1. First player's total = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 Second player's total = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 Score difference = 8 - 4 = 4 </pre> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p> <ul> <li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 1000</code></li> <li><code>1 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li> </ul>
